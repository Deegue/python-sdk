Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,
Nor shall death brag thou wand’rest in his shade,
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow’st.
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

青青河畔草，绵绵思远道。远道不可思，宿昔梦见之。
梦见在我傍，忽觉在他乡。他乡各异县，展转不相见。
枯桑知天风，海水知天寒。入门各自媚，谁肯相为言！
客从远方来，遗我双鲤鱼。呼儿烹鲤鱼，中有尺素书。
长跪读素书，书中竟何如？上言加餐食，下言长相忆。
